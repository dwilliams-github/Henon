# Henon

Plot the Hénon attractor, perhaps better know these days by the
term [Hénon Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9non_map).

I remember the idea for this application came from a friend.
Note that chaos theory was just coming to the public consciousness a
few years earlier around 1988, partly due to the publication of
[Chaos: Making a New Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science) by James Gleick. I think I still
have an original hardcopy edition of this book.

The application had a simple dialog box for entering the parameters
of the attractor. The main window had a zoom feature enabled by
selecting a region.

This application is dated January 1994. It looks like the
project was originally started in May 1990. Maybe I updated
the code for a new computer with a larger screen.
